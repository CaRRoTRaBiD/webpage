I am an associate professor of finance at the [department of finance](https://www.bf.uzh.ch) of the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch). I am also a a [Swiss Finance Institute](https://https://www.sfi.ch/en) faculty member. My current research interests lie in the intersection of corporate finance and causal inference.   

Among other things, I teach Empirical Corporate Finance, Advanced Empirical Finance and Takeovers Restructuring and Corporate Governance at the University of Zurich. I did my PhD at the Stockholm School of Economics.

My integration into Swiss society includes hiking, skiing and beginner(!) climbing.
