I am an associate professor of finance at the University of Zurich. My current research interests include corporate finance and causal inference.   

Among other things, I teach Empirical Corporate Finance, Advanced Empirical Finance and Takeovers Restructuring and Corporate Governance at the University of Zurich. I did my PhD at the Stockholm School of Economics.

My integration into Swiss society includes hiking, skiing and beginner(!) climbing.
