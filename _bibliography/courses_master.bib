  abstract  = "This course aims to teach students tools in empirical finance. To do so the course will cover the following topics: risk and return, estimating betas, tests of asset pricing models and factor models. The course will replicate fundamental results in empirical finance using Swiss data and thereby provide students with valuable context. All empirical analysis will be performed in the R programming language. Moreover, leading academic papers will be presented to illustrate recent advances in the field.",

  abstract  = "This course studies mergers and corporate restructuring. The question addressed include: what are the motives for mergers? Which mergers create value? What are the different methods of payment and what motivates their use? What are divestitures and spin-offs and what motivates their use? The course will cover various takeover defenses available to firms. We will examine the motives for going private and leveraged buyouts. Finally, the course will cover the relation between the market for corporate control and corporate governance.

  To understand whether a particular type of merger or corporate event improves shareholder wealth we develop tools to calculate abnormal returns associated with the event and test whether these returns are statistically significant. Additionally, we will look at valuation in the context of acquisitions and restructurings, using standard valuation techniques such as adjusted present value.",
