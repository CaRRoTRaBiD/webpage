  title={The Sovereign Debt Crisis: Flights or Freezes?},
  author={{\"O}stberg, Per and Richter, Thomas},
  abstract={Multiple asset pricing theories predict that large price changes should be associated with abnormal trading volume, inducing investor 
            rebalancing and possibly leading to flights. In contrast, consistent with market microstructure theories, this paper documents freezes, a reduction 
            in trading volume (approximately 30% relative to the previous trading week) during market stress episodes in the European sovereign bond market.
            We trace the market freezes to increasing transaction costs driven by reduced risk bearing capacity of market makers.},
