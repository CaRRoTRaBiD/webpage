  title={Difference-in-differences with Economic Factors and the Case of Housing Returns},
  author={Huang, Jiyuan and {\"O}stberg, Per},
  abstract={This paper studies how to incorporate observable factors in difference-in-differences and document their empirical relevance.
We show that even under random assignment directly adding factors with unit-specific loadings into the difference-in-differences estimation results in biased estimates. 
This bias, which we term the “bad time control problem” arises when the treatment effect covaries with the factor variation. Researchers often control for factor structures
by using: (i) unit time trends, (ii) pre-treatment covariates interacted with a time trend and (iii) group-time dummies.
We show that all these methods suffer from the bad time control problem and/or omitted factor bias. We propose two solutions 
to the bad time control problem. To evaluate the relevance of the factor structure we study US housing returns.
Adding macroeconomic factors shows that factors have additional explanatory power and estimated factor loadings differ systematically across geographic areas. This results in substantially altered treatment effects.},

  title={The Sovereign Debt Crisis: Flights or Freezes?},
  author={{\"O}stberg, Per and Richter, Thomas},
  abstract={Multiple asset pricing theories predict that large price changes should be associated with abnormal trading volume, inducing investor 
            rebalancing and possibly leading to flights. In contrast, consistent with market microstructure theories, this paper documents freezes, a reduction 
            in trading volume (approximately 30% relative to the previous trading week) during market stress episodes in the European sovereign bond market.
            We trace the market freezes to increasing transaction costs driven by reduced risk bearing capacity of market makers.},
